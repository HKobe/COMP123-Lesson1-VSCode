<p>My name is Hassan Kobeissi.I was born in Canada but my background is Lebanese. My favourite fast food is sushi and hakka noodles with shrimp. 
   I drive a Ford Focus 2012 but wish to be driving the all new 2016 Ford Focus RS. My top tv show is The Big Bang Theory followed by Gotham. My long term objective? To fly and board
   an airplane (yes, i've never traveled). I graduated from Wexford Collegiate School for the arts and currently enrolled in Centennial College Progress Campus (Semester 2).
    I'm here taking the Software engineering course with no real experience, as the rapper Drake would say i've "started from the bottom". 
   My favourite qoute is "practice makes perfect only if it's perfect practice that you're practicing"
